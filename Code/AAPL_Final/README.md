## AAPL_Final

The ‘Final’ folder contains the final versions of the machine learning models we used.  There are certain libraries, such as datetime, yfinance and pandas_datareader that will need to be installed in order to properly run some of the notebooks.  There are no data files needed, other than the data files that the notebooks create themselves.
