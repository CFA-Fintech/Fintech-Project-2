## AAPL_Final

Current version of Project 2 files

I’ve put the current, hopefully final, version of all the Jupyter Notebooks in this Repo.  Brief description of each:

1.	stock-market-analysis-prediction-using-lstm-basket.ipynb – This is an interesting Notebook that looks/compares a number of Technology stocks, including Apple, and then projects the price of Apple.  While this Notebook doesn’t have any trading in it, it does have new libraries and some interesting charts that could be used in the presentation.

2.	stock-market-analysis-prediction-using-lstm-AAPL.ipynb – same as above but takes out all of the non-Apple data.

3.	trading_dashboard-AAPL.ipynb – Notebook creating a dashboard of relevant Apple stock market data.  May have some interesting data/charts for the presentation.

4.	trading_signal_features-AAPL.ipynb – Creates the trading signals CSV file for use in the Random Forest model.

5.	random_forest_training-AAPL.ipynb – Code for training the Apple trading signal data.

6.	random_forest_trading-AAPL.ipynb – Code for actually trading (testing) the Random Forest model.

7.	support_and_resistance_levels.ipynb – Code to calculate and plot support and resistance levels for Apple stock.  Final chart might be interesting for use in the presentation.

8.	algorithmic-trading-with-keras-using-lstm-AAPL.ipynb – This is the LTSM code we have been working on.

As you know, our Repo, containing all of our code/files (but not our presentation PowerPoint), is due this Wednesday the 20th.  Our presentation is due that Saturday, the 23rd.
