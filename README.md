Our project is to create a trading algorithm for Apple (AAPL) stock. We'll fit a random forest algorithm to 5 years of AAPL stock market data to create a predictive model. We will also fit a deep neural network model to the data and compare the performance of both models to determine which has the best predictive power to maximize potential portfolio value.

## Overview
* We are interested in stock market trading algotrthms

* We will use DataReader and yfinance (Yahoo Finance) 

* Machine learning and stat models expect to explore are: 
   * RandomForest
   * Deep Neural Network
   * LSTM
   * Moving Averages
   * Bollinger Bands
   * Exponetal Smoothing

## Model Eval
* Ending portfolio values to evaluate the models
