Our project is to create a trading algorithm, using Apple (AAPL) stock as a baseline. We'll fit a random forest algorithm to 5 years of AAPL stock market data to create a predictive model. We will also fit a LSTM and/or deep neural network model to the data and compare the performance of both models to determine which has the best predictive power to maximize potential portfolio value.

## Overview
* We are interested in stock market trading algotrthms

* We will use DataReader and yfinance (Yahoo Finance) to obtain our stock market data (AAPL)

* Machine learning models we expect to utilize are: 
   * Random Forest
   * Deep Neural Network
   * LSTM
   
* Statistical models we expect to explore are:   
   * Exponential Moving Average of Closing Prices
   * Exponential Moving Average of Daily Return Volatility
   * Bollinger Band
   * Exponential Smoothing

## Model Evaluation
* Ending portfolio values under each machine learning model will be used to evaluate the models
