# Fintech-Project-2

Our project is to create a trading algorithm for Apple (AAPL) stock. We'll fit a random forest algorithm to 5 years of AAPL stock market data to create a predictive model. We will also fit a deep neural network model to the data and compare the performance of both models to determine which has the best predictive power to maximize potential portfolio value.

## Overview
We interest in stock market trading algotrthms

We will use DataReader and yfinance (Yahoo Finance)

Machine leader and stat models expect to explore are: 
RandomForest
Deep Neural Network
LSTM
Moving averages
Bolinger band
Exponetal Smoothing

## Model Eval
Ending portfolio values to evaluate the models
