# Fintech-Project-2

Our project is to create a trading algorithm for Apple (AAPL) stock.  We'll fit a random forest algorithm to 5 years of AAPL stock market data to create a predictive model.  We will also fit a deep neural network model to the data and compare the performance of both models to determine which has the best predictive power to maximize potential portfolio value.
